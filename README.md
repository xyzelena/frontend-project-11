## Description: 

__RSS-reader__ is a site for automatically collecting messages from sources that export to RSS formats, such as titles, descriptions and news links.

You can view the site via the link in [Vercel](https://frontend-project-11-af6bgm782-xyzelenas-projects.vercel.app)

## Principle of operation
The user enters the addresses of sources of interest into the aggregator. 

Next, the aggregator independently checks the sources for updates at a specified interval, and if there are any, notifies the user about the updates, after which the user has the opportunity to familiarize himself with them.
